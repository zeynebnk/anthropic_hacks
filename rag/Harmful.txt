- Acquisition, e.g., synthesizing precursors, ordering controlled chemicals, or diverting samples from labs.
- Production, e.g., chemical synthesis, purification, or scaling up production.
- Formulation, e.g., concentrating chemical agents, creating binary agents, encapsulating chemicals with protective coatings or carriers, aerosolizing or preparing liquid formulations for dissemination.
- Weaponization and delivery:
- Stabilizing the chemical to survive storage and deployment.
- Processing the agent into a form suitable for dissemination (e.g., aerosol, vapor, liquid).
- Integrating the chemical material with a delivery mechanism (e.g., munition, sprayer).
- Developing targeting or release systems for the weapon.
- Developing logistics plans for releasing to accomplish intended effects.
- Circumventing controls related to chemical-synthesis screening, export controls (all chemical agents and precursor equipment), obtaining restricted chemicals from suppliers, and order screening from contract research organizations, for any Schedule-1 or Schedule-2 chemical.
- Data on how to access chemical laboratories.
- Data on when and where chemical research is ongoing,
